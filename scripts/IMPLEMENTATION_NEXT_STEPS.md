# Arlo API Implementation Guide

**Status**: Ready to implement
**Prerequisites**: ‚úÖ Authentication working, device list retrieved
**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours

---

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Create ArloAdapter.ts (30 minutes)

- [ ] Create `src/services/devices/ArloAdapter.ts`
- [ ] Create `src/types/arlo.ts` for API types
- [ ] Add authentication headers
- [ ] Implement `getDevices()` method
- [ ] Filter for active devices (state === 'provisioned')
- [ ] Add error handling

### Phase 2: Device Mapping (20 minutes)

- [ ] Transform Arlo API response to HomeHub `Device` interface
- [ ] Map device properties (id, name, type, status)
- [ ] Handle battery/signal strength if available
- [ ] Test mapping with 7 active devices

### Phase 3: Component Integration (20 minutes)

- [ ] Update `SecurityCameras.tsx` to use ArloAdapter
- [ ] Add loading state while fetching
- [ ] Add error handling (token expiration, network errors)
- [ ] Test in UI with real devices

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (10 minutes)

- [ ] Verify all 7 devices display correctly
- [ ] Check device details (name, type, status)
- [ ] Test error cases (expired token)
- [ ] Document token refresh process

## üéØ Quick Decision Point

### Option A: Implement Now (Recommended if time permits)

**Pros:**

- Momentum is high, context is fresh
- Working auth headers ready to copy
- Clear implementation path
- ~1 hour to working integration

**Cons:**

- Tokens will expire in 24-48 hours
- Will need manual refresh process

**Best for:** If you want to see real cameras in HomeHub immediately

---

### Option B: Implement Later

**Pros:**

- Can think about token refresh strategy first
- Time to review code structure
- No rush, can implement carefully

**Cons:**

- Lose current context/momentum
- May need to re-understand the flow
- Tokens might expire before implementation

**Best for:** If you need a break or want to plan token refresh first

---

## üöÄ If Implementing Now: Quick Start

I can create these files for you:

1. **src/types/arlo.ts** - TypeScript interfaces for Arlo API
2. **src/services/devices/ArloAdapter.ts** - Main adapter class
3. Update **src/components/SecurityCameras.tsx** - Use real data

This will give you a working Arlo integration in ~30 minutes.

Would you like me to proceed with implementation?

## üìù Alternative: Document & Pause

If you'd prefer to pause here, I can:

1. Create comprehensive documentation of what we discovered
2. Save all working headers and endpoints
3. Create a "resume from here" guide for later
4. Document the token refresh challenge

This ensures you can pick up later without losing progress.

---

## ‚ö° My Recommendation

**Implement the basic ArloAdapter now** (30 min):

- You'll see your real cameras in HomeHub
- Builds on current momentum
- Token expiration is acceptable for now
- Can add refresh mechanism later

**Then document token refresh strategy** (15 min):

- Create guide for manual refresh
- Plan for Phase 4-5 (token generation) later
- Add TODO for automatic refresh

This gives you a working system today with a clear upgrade path.

**What would you like to do?**

1. ‚úÖ **Implement ArloAdapter now** - I'll create the files
2. üìÑ **Document and pause** - Save progress for later
3. ü§î **Discuss token refresh first** - Plan before implementing

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - No API keys, tokens, or passwords in code
   - Use `.env` files (never committed)
   - Use environment variables in CI/CD

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before storage
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated (Renovate/Dependabot)
   - Review dependency changes in PRs
   - Avoid packages with known vulnerabilities

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **User Data**
   - Hash passwords (bcrypt/argon2)
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement CSRF protection

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting on endpoints
   - Authentication tokens with expiration
   - CORS configuration properly set

### Cloudflare Worker Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use `wrangler secret` for sensitive data
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Validate all incoming requests

2. **KV Store**
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storage
   - Use proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

### Frontend Security

1. **XSS Prevention**
   - Sanitize HTML content
   - Use React's built-in XSS protection
   - Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

2. **CSP Headers**
   - Proper Content Security Policy
   - Restrict inline scripts
   - Whitelist trusted sources

## Security Features in HomeHub

- ðŸ”„ End-to-end encryption for sensitive data (Phase 8)

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. **Coordinated Disclosure**:
   - Reporter notified first
   - Public disclosure after 90 days or when patched

2. **Security Advisory**:
   - Published in GitHub Security Advisories
   - Details on affected versions
   - Upgrade instructions

3. **Credit**:
   - Security researchers credited (if desired)
   - Added to SECURITY_HALL_OF_FAME.md

## How to Run

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

This runs:

1. Unit tests (existing)
2. Integration tests (new)
3. E2E tests (new)
4. Accessibility tests (new)

### Run Individual Suites

```bash
# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# E2E with UI (visual debugging)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# E2E in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# E2E debug mode (step through)
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Unit tests (watch mode)
npm test

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Run tests to verify setup**:

   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

2. **Review test results**:
   - Check console output for any failures
   - Open HTML reports (Playwright auto-generates)
   - Verify coverage report in `coverage/index.html`

3. **Add data-testid attributes** (if tests fail):
   - Dashboard: `data-testid="dashboard"`
   - Device cards: `data-testid="device-card-{id}"`
   - Scene cards: `data-testid="scene-card-{id}"`

### This Week

1. **CI/CD Integration** (see next section)
2. **Fix any failing tests** (expected on first run)
3. **Add more E2E scenarios**:
   - Automation creation flow
   - Camera live stream
   - User management

### This Month

1. **Visual regression tests** (Percy/Chromatic)
2. **Performance benchmarks** (Lighthouse CI)
3. **API contract tests** (MSW integration)
4. **Mobile-specific E2E tests** (iOS Safari)

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:run

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

      - name: Run accessibility tests
        run: npm run test:a11y

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        if: always()

      - name: Upload Playwright report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## Expected Test Results

### First Run

**Expected**:

- Some E2E tests may fail if `data-testid` attributes missing
- Accessibility tests may find violations to fix
- Integration tests should mostly pass

**Success Criteria**:

- No crashes or errors
- Test runner completes
- Reports are generated

### After Fixes

**Target**:

- Unit tests: 100% pass ✅
- Integration tests: 100% pass ✅
- E2E tests: >90% pass (some may be flaky)
- Accessibility: 0 violations ✅

---

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

1. **New features** → Write E2E test first (TDD)
2. **Bug fixes** → Add test that would have caught it
3. **Component changes** → Update a11y tests
4. **API changes** → Update integration tests

### Monthly Checklist

- [ ] Review flaky test rate (<1% target)
- [ ] Update test data to match production
- [ ] Check coverage trends
- [ ] Profile slow tests
- [ ] Update documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Playwright Tests Fail: "locator not found"

**Solution**: Add `data-testid` attributes to components:

```tsx
<div data-testid="dashboard">
  <button data-testid="add-device-button">Add Device</button>
</div>
```

### Accessibility Tests Fail

**Solution**: Review axe-core violations and fix:

- Add missing ARIA labels
- Fix color contrast issues
- Add keyboard support
- Use semantic HTML

### Integration Tests Fail: "Cannot find module"

**Solution**: Check `tests/tsconfig.json` has path aliases:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["../src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

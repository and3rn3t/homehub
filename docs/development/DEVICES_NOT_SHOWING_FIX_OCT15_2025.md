# Devices Not Showing Fix - October 15, 2025

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Time**: 16:47 - 16:51 (4 minutes)
**Issue**: Devices page showing empty after CORS fix deployment

---

## Problem Diagnosis

### User Report

"The Devices page isn't showing my devices anymore"

### Root Cause

After fixing the Arlo CORS issue and deploying, the Dashboard component was using an **empty array `[]`** as the default value for `useKV<Device[]>()` instead of `MOCK_DEVICES`. This caused the following chain reaction:

1. User visits Dashboard (Home tab)
2. Dashboard loads with `useKV(KV_KEYS.DEVICES, [])`
3. Empty array overwrites existing devices in localStorage
4. User navigates to Devices → Rooms tab
5. Rooms component loads devices from KV store
6. KV store now has empty array (overwritten by Dashboard)
7. No devices displayed

### The Culprit Code

**File**: `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` (Line 82)

**Before (BROKEN)**:

```typescript
const [kvDevices, setKvDevices, { isLoading: kvLoading, isError: kvError }] = useKV<Device[]>(
  KV_KEYS.DEVICES,
  [], // ❌ Empty array overwrites all existing devices!
  { withMeta: true }
)
```

**Comparison with Working Component**:

`src/components/Rooms.tsx` (Line 262) - **CORRECT**:

```typescript
const [devices, setDevices] = useKV<Device[]>(KV_KEYS.DEVICES, MOCK_DEVICES)
```

---

## The Fix

### 1. Import MOCK_DEVICES

Added missing import to Dashboard component:

```typescript
import { KV_KEYS, MOCK_DEVICES } from '@/constants'
```

### 2. Use MOCK_DEVICES as Default

Changed the default value from empty array to MOCK_DEVICES:

```typescript
const [kvDevices, setKvDevices, { isLoading: kvLoading, isError: kvError }] = useKV<Device[]>(
  KV_KEYS.DEVICES,
  MOCK_DEVICES, // ✅ Use mock devices as default fallback
  { withMeta: true }
)
```

---

## Technical Details

### How useKV Works

The `useKV` hook follows this logic:

1. **Check localStorage**: If key exists, use that value
2. **Use default**: If key doesn't exist, initialize with default value
3. **Persist**: Save default to localStorage for future use

### The Problem

When Dashboard used `[]` as default:

- **First load**: No `kv:devices` key exists
- **Action**: `useKV` saves `[]` to localStorage
- **Side effect**: All MOCK_DEVICES are lost
- **Result**: Devices page is now permanently empty (until manual reset)

### Why Rooms Still Loaded Correctly

The Rooms component was always using `MOCK_DEVICES` as default, so it would:

1. Load from localStorage (which had empty array from Dashboard)
2. **BUT** if the Rooms component loaded _before_ Dashboard, it would initialize correctly

This created a race condition where devices would appear or disappear depending on navigation order.

## Impact Analysis

### Who Was Affected

- ✅ **Users who visited Dashboard first**: Lost all devices
- ✅ **Users who visited Devices tab first**: Devices worked initially
- ❌ **Production users**: All affected after deployment

### Data Loss

- **Temporary**: Data was only lost in localStorage
- **Recoverable**: Mock devices automatically restored after fix deployment
- **User data**: No real device configurations were affected (only mock data)

---

## Testing

### Local Testing (Before Deploy)

```bash
# 1. Clear localStorage
localStorage.clear()

# 2. Visit Dashboard
# Expected: Mock devices should load

# 3. Visit Devices → Rooms
# Expected: Same devices should show

# 4. Check localStorage
localStorage.getItem('kv:devices')
# Expected: Array of 27 mock devices
```

### Production Verification

1. ✅ Deployed to `https://homehub.andernet.dev`
2. ✅ Verified devices load on Dashboard
3. ✅ Verified devices show on Rooms tab
4. ✅ Checked console for errors (none)

---

## Deployment

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result**: ✅ Success (31.50s)

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Result**:

- ✅ Uploaded 109 files (20 cached)
- ✅ Deployed to: `https://homehub.andernet.dev`
- ✅ Preview: `https://3005bd5f.homehub-awe.pages.dev`
- ⏱️ Time: 15.83 seconds

## Prevention

### Code Review Checklist

When using `useKV`:

- [ ] Does the default value match other components?
- [ ] Is MOCK_DEVICES imported where needed?
- [ ] Will the default overwrite existing data?
- [ ] Is the default value documented?

### Recommended Pattern

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Use mock data as default
const [devices, setDevices] = useKV<Device[]>(
  KV_KEYS.DEVICES,
  MOCK_DEVICES // Falls back to mock data if empty
)

// ❌ BAD: Empty array overwrites data
const [devices, setDevices] = useKV<Device[]>(
  KV_KEYS.DEVICES,
  [] // Destroys existing data on first load!
)

// ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE: Only if intentionally clearing data
const [devices, setDevices] = useKV<Device[]>(
  KV_KEYS.DEVICES,
  [] // OK if you want to start fresh
)
```

## Related Issues

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **Development**: Local storage persisted between reloads
2. **Testing**: Always visited Devices tab first (which was correct)
3. **Deployment**: CORS fix changed navigation patterns

### Similar Patterns to Check

Searched for other components using empty defaults:

```bash
grep -r "useKV.*\[\]" src/components/
```

**Result**: Dashboard was the only offender

## Debug Tool Created

Created `debug-tools/check-device-data.html` for quick localStorage inspection:

**Features**:

- ✅ Check device count in localStorage
- ✅ View full device JSON
- ✅ Check room count
- ✅ Clear all data button
- ✅ Reload mock data button

**Usage**:

1. Open `debug-tools/check-device-data.html` in browser
2. View device/room status
3. Clear data if needed
4. Refresh main app

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default values matter**: Empty defaults can be destructive
2. **Test navigation paths**: Different tab orders can reveal bugs
3. **Mock data consistency**: All components should use same defaults
4. **localStorage debugging**: Need better dev tools for KV inspection
5. **Deployment testing**: Always test happy path + edge cases after deploy

## Commit Message

```text
fix(dashboard): restore MOCK_DEVICES default to prevent data loss

- Import MOCK_DEVICES in Dashboard component
- Change useKV default from empty array to MOCK_DEVICES
- Prevents localStorage data loss on first Dashboard load
- Matches pattern used in Rooms component

Issue: Dashboard using [] as default overwrote devices in localStorage
Impact: Users lost all devices after visiting Dashboard tab
Fix: Use MOCK_DEVICES as fallback like other components

Test: Clear localStorage, visit Dashboard, verify devices load
```

5. Device removed from KV store
6. Toast confirms: "{Device Name} removed"

## Technical Implementation

### HueBridgeAdapter Integration

All color controls use existing HueBridgeAdapter methods:

- `adapter.setBrightness(device, value)` - Sets brightness 0-100%
- `adapter.setColor(device, hexColor)` - Sets RGB color with xy conversion
- `adapter.setColorTemperature(device, kelvin)` - Sets temp 2000K-6500K

### Optimistic Updates

Pattern used throughout:

1. Update UI immediately (optimistic)
2. Make API call in background
3. On success: Keep UI state, show toast
4. On failure: Rollback UI, show error toast

### State Management

- **Dashboard**: `selectedDevice` + `controlPanelOpen`
- **Rooms**: `controlDevice` + `controlPanelOpen`
- Both use shared `DeviceControlPanel` component
- Updates flow through `onUpdate` callback → `setDevices` → KV store

### Capability Detection

```typescript
const hasBrightness = device.capabilities?.includes('dimming') ?? false
const hasColor = device.capabilities?.includes('color') ?? false
const hasColorTemp = device.capabilities?.includes('color-temp') ?? false
```

Controls only render if capability present.

## Testing Plan

2. Test color picker with Matt's Table 2
3. Test color temperature with Family Room Speaker Lamp
4. Verify rename/delete functionality
5. Test context menu in Rooms tab

### Future Enhancements

1. **Group Control**: Select multiple devices, apply settings to all
2. **Scheduling**: Set brightness/color schedules (sunrise simulation, etc.)
3. **Favorites Management**: Add/remove devices from Dashboard favorites
4. **Presets**: Save custom color/brightness combinations
5. **Transitions**: Smooth fade animations (duration control)
6. **Scenes**: Create scenes from current device states

## Known Limitations

1. **Inline Styles**: Used for dynamic colors (color picker preview, battery bars)
   - ESLint warnings present but functionality correct
   - Required for real-time color preview

2. **Icon Deprecation**: Phosphor Icons v2 deprecation warnings
   - Non-blocking, icons render correctly
   - Will need migration to v3 syntax in future

3. **No Confirmation on Delete**: Device deletion is instant
   - Consider adding confirmation dialog for safety

4. **No Undo**: Device changes are immediate with no undo
   - Consider adding undo/redo stack

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Color controls accessible from 2 locations (Dashboard + Rooms)
- ✅ All 3 control types implemented (brightness, color, color temp)
- ✅ Capability detection prevents showing unsupported controls
- ✅ Real-time updates with toast notifications
- ✅ Device info panel with metadata display
- ✅ Rename and delete functionality
- ✅ Type-safe with Device interface updates
- ⏳ Ready for end-to-end testing with physical Hue devices

## Conclusion

Color controls and advanced device management are **fully implemented and ready for testing**. The DeviceControlPanel provides a comprehensive interface for controlling all Hue device features through an intuitive two-tab design. Integration with Dashboard and Rooms ensures users can access advanced controls from anywhere devices are displayed.

Next step: **User testing with physical Hue devices** to validate real-world performance and usability. 🎨✨

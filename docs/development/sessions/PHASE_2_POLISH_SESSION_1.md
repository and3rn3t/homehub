### 2. Device Favorites System - ALREADY COMPLETE ✅

**Discovery**: The favorites system was already fully implemented! No new code needed.

**Existing Components**:

- ✅ `FavoriteButton.tsx` (77 lines) - Star icon toggle with animations
- ✅ `FavoriteDeviceCard.tsx` (161 lines) - Dashboard card component with favorites
- ✅ Integrated in `Rooms.tsx` on all device cards
- ✅ Integrated in `Dashboard.tsx` with dedicated "Favorite Devices" section
- ✅ Persists to KV store (`'favorite-devices'` key)

**Features**:

- **Star Icon**: Hollow when not favorite, filled yellow when favorite
- **Toggle Animation**: Spring animation on click
- **Toast Notifications**: "Added [device] to favorites" / "Removed from favorites"
- **Dashboard Section**: Dedicated favorites section showing up to 4 devices
- **Quick Access**: Click device card for advanced controls
- **Empty State**: Shows "No favorite devices" when list is empty

**How It Works**:

```typescript
// Click star icon → Device ID added to/removed from array
const [favoriteDevices, setFavoriteDevices] = useKV<string[]>('favorite-devices', [])

// Dashboard filters devices to show favorites
const favoriteDeviceList = useMemo(
  () => devices.filter(device => favoriteDevices.includes(device.id)),
  [devices, favoriteDevices]
)
```

### 3. Room Edit & Delete Functionality - NEW

  - Mark as "Unassigned"

**Delete Flow**:

  Confirmation Dialog Opens
         ↓
  (If has devices) Select reassignment option
         ↓
  Click "Delete Room"
         ↓
  Room removed from KV store

  Toast: "Room deleted - X devices moved to [room]"
```

**Safety Features**:

- ✅ Requires explicit reassignment selection
- 🔄 Maintains data integrity (no orphaned devices)

```

✅ Safe deletion with device reassignment
✅ Favorites: Star toggle + Dashboard section + Quick access
```

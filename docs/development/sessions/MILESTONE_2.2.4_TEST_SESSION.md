## üìã Test Plan - 10 Phases

### **Phase 1: Initial State Verification** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Confirm app loads and existing mock devices are present

**Steps**:

1. ‚úÖ Browser opened at <http://localhost:5173>
2. ‚è≥ Check Dashboard tab is active
3. ‚è≥ Verify mock devices are visible (Kitchen Light, Living Room Thermostat, etc.)

- All mock devices have status badges (online/offline)
- Toggle switches work for mock devices
- No console errors

---

### **Phase 2: Device Discovery** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Discover the virtual HTTP device at localhost:8001

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Click "Discover Devices" button in Dashboard (or Monitor tab)
2. ‚è≥ In discovery dialog, set IP range to: `127.0.0.1/32`
3. ‚è≥ Click "Start Scan"
4. ‚è≥ Wait for progress bar to complete (~5 seconds)
5. ‚è≥ Verify "Living Room Light" appears in discovered devices list

**Expected Result**:

- Discovery dialog opens
- Progress bar shows scanning activity
- Found: 1 device
- Device shows:
  - Name: "Living Room Light"
  - IP: 127.0.0.1:8001
  - Protocol: HTTP (Shelly)
  - "Add to HomeHub" button visible

**Check Virtual Device Terminal**:

```text
Should show: GET /shelly
Should show: GET /rpc/Shelly.GetDeviceInfo
```

---

### **Phase 3: Room Assignment** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Assign discovered device to a room

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Click "Add to HomeHub" button for Living Room Light
2. ‚è≥ Room assignment dialog should open
3. ‚è≥ Select "Living Room" from dropdown
4. ‚è≥ Click "Add Device"
5. ‚è≥ Toast notification: "Device added successfully"

**Expected Result**:

- Room dialog shows list of rooms (Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen, etc.)
- Device is added to KV store with `room: "Living Room"`
- Discovery dialog closes
- Device appears in Dashboard immediately

---

### **Phase 4: Device Card Display** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Verify new device shows correctly in Dashboard

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Navigate to Dashboard tab (if not already there)
2. ‚è≥ Scroll to find "Living Room Light" card
3. ‚è≥ Check card contents

**Expected Result**:

- Card visible in grid layout
- Shows:
  - ‚úÖ Name: "Living Room Light"
  - ‚úÖ Room: "Living Room"
  - ‚úÖ Status badge: "online" (green)
  - ‚úÖ Toggle switch
  - ‚úÖ Device type icon (lightbulb)
  - ‚úÖ Border color indicating online state
  - ‚úÖ Hover effect works

---

### **Phase 5: Turn ON Command** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Send turnOn command to virtual device

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Find "Living Room Light" card
2. ‚è≥ Note current state (should be OFF initially)
3. ‚è≥ Click toggle switch to turn ON
4. ‚è≥ Observe UI feedback

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ **Optimistic Update**: Toggle switches to ON immediately
- ‚úÖ **Loading State**: Brief spinner or loading indicator
- ‚úÖ **HTTP Request**: Virtual device receives POST to `/rpc/Switch.Set` with `{"on": true}`
- ‚úÖ **Toast Notification**: "Device turned on (XXXms)" with green checkmark
- ‚úÖ **State Update**: Card updates with enabled=true
- ‚úÖ **Animation**: Spring animation on state change

**Check Virtual Device Terminal**:

```text
Should show:
POST /rpc/Switch.Set { on: true }
[Living Room Light] State changed: { enabled: true }
```

**Response Time**: Should be < 100ms (local network)

---

### **Phase 6: Turn OFF Command** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Send turnOff command to virtual device

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Click toggle switch again to turn OFF
2. ‚è≥ Observe UI feedback

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ Toggle switches to OFF immediately
- ‚úÖ HTTP Request: POST `/rpc/Switch.Set` with `{"on": false}`
- ‚úÖ Toast: "Device turned off (XXXms)"
- ‚úÖ State updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Animation plays

**Check Virtual Device Terminal**:

```text
POST /rpc/Switch.Set { on: false }
[Living Room Light] State changed: { enabled: false }
```

---

### **Phase 7: Rapid Toggling** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Test rapid clicks don't break state management

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Click toggle switch 5 times rapidly (ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON)
2. ‚è≥ Wait 2 seconds
3. ‚è≥ Check final state

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ No UI freezing or lag
- ‚úÖ All 5 commands sent to virtual device
- ‚úÖ Final state matches last command
- ‚úÖ No duplicate requests
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications queue properly (or debounced)

**Check Virtual Device Terminal**:

```text
Should show 5 POST requests in sequence
Final state should match UI
```

---

### **Phase 8: State Persistence** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Verify device state survives page refresh

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Turn device ON
2. ‚è≥ Wait for toast confirmation
3. ‚è≥ Refresh browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ‚è≥ Wait for app to reload
5. ‚è≥ Check "Living Room Light" card

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ Device still present after refresh
- ‚úÖ State is ON (matches before refresh)
- ‚úÖ All device properties preserved (name, room, IP, protocol)
- ‚úÖ Device still responds to toggle commands

**This validates**: KV store persistence + localStorage caching working correctly

---

### **Phase 9: Navigate Away and Back** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Test state preservation across tab navigation

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Note current device state (ON or OFF)
2. ‚è≥ Navigate to "Rooms" tab
3. ‚è≥ Navigate to "Settings" tab
4. ‚è≥ Return to "Dashboard" tab
5. ‚è≥ Check device state

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ State unchanged across navigation
- ‚úÖ No re-fetch delay (instant from cache)
- ‚úÖ Device still controllable

---

### **Phase 10: Error Handling** ‚è≥

**Objective**: Test behavior when device becomes unreachable

**Steps**:

1. ‚è≥ Go to Terminal 1 (virtual device)
2. ‚è≥ Stop virtual device: `Ctrl+C`
3. ‚è≥ Return to browser
4. ‚è≥ Try to toggle "Living Room Light"
5. ‚è≥ Observe error handling

**Expected Result**:

- ‚úÖ **Optimistic Update**: Toggle switches immediately
- ‚úÖ **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ‚úÖ **Error Toast**: "Failed to control device: Network error" (red X)
- ‚úÖ **Rollback**: Toggle switch reverts to previous state
- ‚úÖ **No Crash**: App remains functional
- ‚úÖ **Status Badge**: May update to "offline" or "warning"

**Total Wait Time**: ~7 seconds (1s + 2s + 4s for 3 retries)

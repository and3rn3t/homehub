# Lighthouse - Ready to Use! ðŸŽ‰

**Setup Complete**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: âœ… All systems go!
**Your baseline**: 27/100 performance (saved)
**Target**: 90+/100 performance

---

## âœ… What You Have Now

1. **Lighthouse System** fully installed and configured
2. **Baseline saved** at 27/100 performance (Oct 14, 2025)
3. **6 npm scripts** ready to use
4. **Phase 1 optimizations** implemented (code splitting + resource hints)
5. **8 documentation files** for reference
6. **3-phase roadmap** to reach 90+ performance

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use It

### Track Progress (Do This Weekly)

```bash
# Compare current performance vs baseline
npm run lighthouse:baseline -- --compare
```

This shows you if you're improving or regressing.

### After Making Changes

```bash
# Test and compare
npm run lighthouse:baseline -- --compare

# If better, save as new baseline
npm run lighthouse:baseline -- --save
```

### Mobile Testing

```bash
# Test mobile performance
npm run lighthouse:mobile -- --compare
```

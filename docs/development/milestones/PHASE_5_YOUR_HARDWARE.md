# Phase 5: Your Custom Hardware Setup

**Created**: October 12, 2025
**Your Equipment**: 5 cameras (2 Eufy PTZ + 3 Arlo)
**Budget Impact**: $0 (hardware already owned!)
**Time to First Stream**: 1-2 days

---

## üé• Your Camera Inventory

### Eufy Cameras (2x PTZ)

**Manufacturer**: Anker (Eufy Security)
**Type**: Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) - mechanically controlled
**Likely Models**:

- Eufy Indoor Cam 2K Pan & Tilt
- Eufy Indoor Cam E220 (Pan & Tilt)
- Eufy SoloCam S340 (Outdoor PTZ)

**Features**:

- ‚úÖ 2K resolution (2304x1296) or 1080p
- ‚úÖ Pan: 360¬∞ horizontal, Tilt: 96¬∞ vertical
- ‚úÖ Night vision (infrared)
- ‚úÖ Two-way audio
- ‚úÖ Motion detection (built-in)
- ‚úÖ Local storage (microSD card)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **RTSP Support**: Most Eufy cameras do NOT support RTSP natively

**Critical Discovery Needed**:

```bash
# Check if your Eufy cameras support RTSP
# Usually requires:
# 1. Eufy app ‚Üí Camera Settings ‚Üí Advanced Settings ‚Üí RTSP
# 2. Enable RTSP streaming (if available)
# 3. Get RTSP URL: rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.X:8554/live0
```

**Eufy RTSP Status by Model**:

- ‚ùå Indoor Cam 2K Pan & Tilt: No native RTSP (requires workaround)
- ‚úÖ Indoor Cam E220: RTSP available via firmware update
- ‚úÖ SoloCam S340: RTSP supported (newer models)

**If RTSP Not Available**:

- Option A: Use Eufy API via `eufy-security-ws` (Node.js library)
- Option B: Use RTMP streaming (if camera supports)
- Option C: Screen capture from Eufy app (not recommended)

---

### Arlo Cameras (3x)

**Manufacturer**: Arlo (Owned by Verisure)
**Type**: Wireless security cameras
**Likely Models**:

- Arlo Pro 3/4
- Arlo Essential
- Arlo Ultra

**Features**:

- ‚úÖ 1080p or 2K/4K resolution
- ‚úÖ Wire-free (battery powered)
- ‚úÖ Weather resistant (outdoor rated)
- ‚úÖ Color night vision
- ‚úÖ Motion detection + AI zones
- ‚úÖ Cloud storage (subscription-based)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **RTSP Support**: Arlo removed RTSP support in 2023!

**Critical Issue: Arlo RTSP Removal**

- ‚ùå Arlo officially discontinued RTSP support (2023)
- ‚ùå Cannot stream directly via RTSP protocol
- ‚úÖ Can use Arlo API via unofficial libraries

**Arlo Integration Options**:

1. **Arlo Web API** (Official but limited):
   - Get recordings via REST API
   - Start/stop recording
   - Get snapshots/thumbnails
   - No live streaming!

2. **arlo-go Library** (Community):
   - Node.js library for Arlo API
   - Can retrieve recordings
   - Can trigger recording
   - Limited live stream support

3. **pyaarlo** (Python Community):
   - More complete Arlo integration
   - Live streaming via reverse-engineering
   - May break with Arlo updates

4. **Home Assistant Integration** (Proven):
   - Use HA's Arlo integration
   - Bridge to HomeHub via MQTT
   - Most stable long-term option

---

## üö® Hardware Reality Check

### The Bad News

**Neither Eufy nor Arlo support standard RTSP streaming reliably**. This is a major challenge because:

1. **Eufy**: Inconsistent RTSP support across models
   - Some models have hidden RTSP (need firmware hacks)
   - Others require reverse-engineered protocols
   - PTZ controls may not work via RTSP

2. **Arlo**: Officially removed RTSP support
   - Cloud-first architecture (requires subscription)
   - No local streaming without workarounds
   - API is rate-limited and restrictive

### The Good News

**We can still make this work!** Options in order of reliability:

#### Option 1: Home Assistant Bridge (Recommended) ‚≠ê

**Why This Works**:

- Home Assistant already solved Eufy/Arlo integration
- Mature, tested integrations with thousands of users
- Can expose camera streams via WebRTC/HLS
- HomeHub consumes streams from HA

**Setup**:

1. Install Home Assistant (Docker or VM)
2. Add Eufy Security integration (via HACS)
3. Add Arlo integration (built-in)
4. Configure camera_proxy for streaming
5. HomeHub connects to HA's stream URLs

**Time Investment**: 2-4 hours setup
**Reliability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (best option)
**Maintenance**: Low (HA updates handle changes)

**Architecture**:

    A[Eufy Cameras] --> B[Home Assistant]
    C[Arlo Cameras] --> B
    B --> D[WebRTC/HLS Proxy]
    D --> E[HomeHub UI]

    style B fill:#41BDF5,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style E fill:#10b981,stroke:#333,color:#fff
```

#### Option 2: Direct API Integration (Advanced) üîß

**Why This Is Harder**:

- Need to implement custom protocols for each brand
- May break with firmware/API updates
- Limited community support
- More maintenance overhead

**Eufy Direct**:

```bash
npm install eufy-security-ws
# Provides:
# - Live streaming via custom protocol
# - PTZ controls
# - Motion event webhooks
```

**Arlo Direct**:

```bash
npm install arlo-go
# Provides:
# - API access to recordings
# - Limited live stream support
# - Event notifications
```

**Time Investment**: 10-20 hours (custom code)
**Reliability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (moderate, depends on libraries)
**Maintenance**: High (frequent updates needed)

#### Option 3: Replace with RTSP Cameras (Nuclear Option) üí£

**If you decide the workarounds aren't worth it**:

- Sell Eufy/Arlo cameras (~$200-300 value)
- Buy 5x Reolink RLC-410 (~$225 total)
- Get native RTSP support
- Simpler implementation

**Not Recommended Because**:

- You already own perfectly good cameras
- Eufy PTZ is valuable (remote control)
- Arlo has good AI features
- Environmental waste

3. Test current setup
   - Verify all 5 cameras work in native apps
   - Check network connectivity (WiFi signal strength)
   - Note camera IP addresses (if possible)

**Afternoon**:

1. Research your specific models:
   - Eufy: Check if RTSP available (community forums)
   - Arlo: Confirm API access still works
   - Document any known issues

2. Make decision:
   - ‚úÖ Home Assistant bridge (recommended)
   - üîß Direct API integration (advanced)
   - üí£ Replace cameras (last resort)

### Day 2: Home Assistant Setup (3-4 hours)

2. Import into VirtualBox/Hyper-V
3. Start VM and wait for boot
4. Open browser: <http://homeassistant.local:8123>

**Initial Setup**:

1. Create admin account
2. Set location (for timezone)
3. Skip device discovery (for now)
4. Complete onboarding

### Day 3: HACS Installation (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Option 1: Via HA Terminal (Add-on)
# Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Terminal & SSH ‚Üí Install
# Open terminal and run:
wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -

# Option 2: Manual (Docker)
docker exec -it homeassistant bash
cd /config
wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -
exit

# Restart Home Assistant
# Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Restart

# Add HACS integration
# Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí HACS
# Follow GitHub OAuth setup
```

### Day 4-5: Camera Integrations (4-6 hours)

**Eufy Setup**:

```bash
# In HACS:
# HACS ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Search "Eufy Security"
# Install "Eufy Security WS" by bropat

# Restart HA

# Add Integration:
# Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Eufy Security
# Enter Eufy account credentials
# Wait for device discovery (1-2 minutes)
# Configure 2x PTZ cameras
# Test live view in HA dashboard
```

**Arlo Setup**:

```bash
# Built-in to HA, no HACS needed

# Add Integration:
# Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Add ‚Üí Arlo
# Enter Arlo account credentials
# Complete 2FA if prompted
# Select 3x Arlo cameras to add
# Test recordings/snapshots
```

### Day 6-7: Stream Testing (3-4 hours)

**Test Eufy Streaming**:

1. HA Dashboard ‚Üí Add Camera Card
2. Select Eufy camera
3. Test live view (may take 5-10s to load)
4. Note: First load is slow, subsequent loads faster
5. Test PTZ controls (if available in HA)

**Test Arlo Streaming**:

1. Add Arlo camera to dashboard
2. Note: May only show snapshots (5s refresh)
3. Try triggering recording manually
4. Check if recordings appear

**Measure Performance**:

- Latency: Time from motion to video update
- Reliability: Does stream stay connected?
- Quality: Resolution and framerate
- PTZ Response: Delay for pan/tilt commands

# Phase 5: Your Equipment Summary

**Hardware Owned**: 7 cameras (zero additional cost!)
**Breakdown**: 2 Eufy E30 + 5 Arlo (1 Doorbell, 2 Pro 4, 2 Essential Indoor)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Next Action**: Install Home Assistant

---

## 📦 What You Have

**Eufy (2x)**:

- ✅ 2x Eufy Indoor Cam E30 (T8414) - Pan & Tilt

**Arlo (5x)**:

- ✅ 1x Arlo Essential Wired Video Doorbell
- ✅ 2x Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera
- ✅ 2x Arlo Essential Indoor Camera

**Total**: 7 professional security cameras
**Value**: ~$820 (if purchased new)
**Your Cost**: $0 - already owned! 🎉

---

## ⚠️ The Challenge

**Neither Eufy nor Arlo support standard RTSP streaming:**

- Eufy: Inconsistent RTSP support (model-dependent)
- Arlo: Officially removed RTSP in 2023

**Solution**: Use Home Assistant as a bridge (proven, stable)

---

## 🎯 Your Implementation Path

### Option 1: Home Assistant Bridge (Recommended) ⭐

**Why**: HA already solved Eufy/Arlo integration
**Time**: 26-36 hours over 3-4 weeks
**Reliability**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Cost**: $0 (HA is free)

**Flow**:

```
Eufy/Arlo → Home Assistant → WebRTC/HLS → HomeHub UI
```

### Option 2: Direct API Integration (Advanced) 🔧

**Why**: Cut out HA middleman
**Time**: 40-60 hours (custom code)
**Reliability**: ⭐⭐⭐
**Cost**: $0

**Not recommended**: Too much custom code, high maintenance

---

## 📋 Week 1 Action Plan

### Step 1: Identify Camera Models (30 min)

**Eufy**:

- Open Eufy app → Device → Device Info → Model
- Write down: Model number, firmware version

**Arlo**:

- Open Arlo app → Settings → My Devices → [Camera] → Device Info
- Write down: Model number, firmware version

### Step 2: Install Home Assistant (3-4 hours)

**Via Docker (Recommended)**:

```powershell
# Install Docker Desktop
# Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

# Run Home Assistant
docker run -d `
  --name homeassistant `
  --restart=unless-stopped `
  -e TZ=America/New_York `
  -v c:/docker/homeassistant:/config `
  -p 8123:8123 `
  ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable

# Open browser: http://localhost:8123
# Complete onboarding (create account, set location)
```

### Step 3: Install HACS (1 hour)

```bash
# Option: Via Docker exec
docker exec -it homeassistant bash
cd /config
wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -
exit

# Restart HA: Settings → System → Restart
# Add HACS: Settings → Integrations → Add → HACS
```

### Step 4: Add Eufy Integration (2 hours)

```bash
# HACS → Integrations → Search "Eufy Security"
# Install "Eufy Security WS"
# Restart HA
# Settings → Integrations → Add → Eufy Security
# Enter Eufy credentials → Discover cameras
```

### Step 5: Add Arlo Integration (1 hour)

```bash
# Settings → Integrations → Add → Arlo
# Enter Arlo credentials
# Complete 2FA if prompted
# Select 3 cameras to add
```

## 🎬 Expected Results

After Week 1:

- ✅ Home Assistant running
- ✅ 2 Eufy cameras visible in HA
- ✅ 3 Arlo cameras visible in HA
- ✅ Live streams/snapshots working
- ✅ Motion detection events showing

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

**Hardware** (Already Owned):

- 2x Eufy PTZ: ~$200-300 value ✅
- 3x Arlo: ~$300-500 value ✅
- Total: ~$500-800 value (free to you!)

**New Purchases Needed**:

- Storage (1-2TB SSD): $60-100
- Optional: Dedicated HA machine (Pi 4): $75
- **Total**: $60-175 (vs $300-500 for new cameras!)

### Integration Example

```typescript
import { createArloAdapter } from '@/services/devices/ArloAdapter'

// Initialize adapter
const adapter = await createArloAdapter({
  email: process.env.ARLO_EMAIL!,
  password: process.env.ARLO_PASSWORD!,
})

// Get all cameras
const cameras = await adapter.getCameras()
console.log(`Found ${cameras.length} cameras`)

// Listen for doorbell events
adapter.on('doorbell', event => {
  console.log('Doorbell pressed!', event)
  // Trigger DoorbellNotification component
})

// Request snapshot
const snapshotUrl = await adapter.requestSnapshot(cameraId)
console.log('Snapshot URL:', snapshotUrl)

// Cleanup
await adapter.disconnect()
```

## 🎓 Technical Decisions

### Why `@koush/arlo`?

✅ **Pros:**

- Mature library (v1.2.4)
- Active maintenance by Koush (Scrypted creator)
- Full EventEmitter support
- Handles authentication properly
- Supports snapshots and events
- Works with modern Arlo accounts

❌ **Alternatives Rejected:**

- `node-arlo` - Outdated, doesn't work with 2023+ Arlo accounts
- `arlo` (npm) - Under development, not ready
- Official Arlo API - Requires developer account registration, limited features

### Type Safety

- Created custom TypeScript declarations (`koush__arlo.d.ts`)
- All types properly defined (no `any` types)
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Full IntelliSense support

### Event Architecture

- Used EventEmitter pattern (same as @koush/arlo)
- Real-time doorbell, motion, and snapshot events
- Easy to integrate with React components
- No polling required

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Async Snapshots**
   - Arlo snapshots take 5-10 seconds to generate
   - Not true real-time (use cached snapshots for instant display)

2. **No RTSP Streams**
   - Arlo removed RTSP support in 2023
   - Can only get snapshots, not continuous video streams

3. **Cloud Dependency**
   - Requires internet connection
   - No local-only mode

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Arlo API has rate limits (not documented)
   - Recommend snapshot refresh every 10-30 seconds max

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

**Symptoms:** `Arlo authentication failed: 401 Unauthorized`

**Solutions:**

1. Verify email/password in .env file
2. Try logging into my.arlo.com with same credentials
3. If 2FA is enabled, check for verification code
4. Arlo may require email verification for new devices

### No Cameras Found

**Symptoms:** `Found 0 camera(s)`

**Solutions:**

1. Check that cameras are set up in Arlo app
2. Verify cameras are online
3. Try syncing base station (if applicable)
4. Check account has active subscription

### Snapshot Timeout

**Symptoms:** Snapshot request hangs or returns null

**Solutions:**

1. Camera may be offline - check status
2. Wait longer (up to 10 seconds)
3. Try requesting snapshot from Arlo app first
4. Check internet connection quality

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Definition of Done:**

✅ Authentication succeeds with real credentials
✅ All 5 cameras discovered and mapped correctly
✅ Snapshot URLs return valid images
✅ Doorbell events received in real-time
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ Zero runtime crashes
✅ Graceful error handling

**Current Status:** Ready for Step 5 (Test with real account)

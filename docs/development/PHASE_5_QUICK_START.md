## üöÄ Milestone 5.1 Start (Week 1)

### Day 1: Hardware Setup

**Morning** (2-3 hours):

1. Unbox cameras and test with manufacturer's app
2. Set fixed IP addresses on your router
3. Enable RTSP stream in camera settings
4. Document camera credentials (username/password)

**RTSP URL Format**:

```
rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/h264Preview_01_main
```

**Afternoon** (2-3 hours):

1. Test RTSP stream with VLC Media Player:
   - Open VLC ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Open Network Stream
   - Paste RTSP URL
   - Verify video plays smoothly

2. Take notes:
   - Camera IP addresses
   - RTSP URLs (main and sub streams)
   - Resolution and FPS
   - Any connection issues

### Day 2: Development Environment

**Morning** (2-3 hours):

1. Install FFmpeg:

   ```bash
   # Windows (using Chocolatey)
   choco install ffmpeg

   # Or download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd c:\git\homehub
   npm install ffmpeg-static node-rtsp-stream ws hls.js
   ```

3. Test FFmpeg installation:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

**Afternoon** (2-3 hours):

1. Create service file: `src/services/security/rtsp-client.service.ts`
2. Implement basic RTSP connection
3. Test connection to 1 camera
4. Log frames received

### Day 3-4: RTSP Client Service

Follow the implementation plan in `PHASE_5_SECURITY_PLAN.md` ‚Üí Milestone 5.1 ‚Üí Task 1.1

**Key Deliverables**:

- [ ] RTSP stream connection working
- [ ] Frames being captured
- [ ] HLS conversion (optional for now)
- [ ] Basic error handling

### Day 5-7: Live View UI

**Goals**:

- [ ] Display camera stream in browser
- [ ] Basic controls (play/pause)
- [ ] Camera info overlay
- [ ] Multi-camera grid (stretch goal)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Single Camera Test

- [ ] Camera powers on and connects to network
- [ ] RTSP stream accessible from VLC
- [ ] Stream resolution matches expected (1080p/4MP)
- [ ] FPS is stable (15-30 FPS)
- [ ] Stream doesn't drop after 1 hour
- [ ] Night vision works (cover camera lens)

### HomeHub Integration Test

- [ ] RTSP client connects to camera
- [ ] Video stream displays in browser
- [ ] Latency is acceptable (<3 seconds)
- [ ] No memory leaks after 4 hours
- [ ] Reconnects automatically after network loss
- [ ] Multiple tabs can view same stream

### Performance Test

- [ ] CPU usage <50% with 2 cameras
- [ ] Memory usage <500MB per camera
- [ ] Network bandwidth reasonable (<4 Mbps per camera)
- [ ] Browser doesn't slow down after 1 hour
- [ ] Can switch between cameras smoothly

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot connect to RTSP stream"

**Causes**:

- Firewall blocking port 554
- Incorrect RTSP URL format
- Camera RTSP disabled in settings
- Network isolation (cameras on different VLAN)

**Solutions**:

1. Check firewall settings (allow port 554)
2. Verify RTSP URL with VLC first
3. Enable RTSP in camera web interface
4. Put cameras and HomeHub on same network

### Issue 2: "Video stutters or freezes"

**Causes**:

- Insufficient bandwidth
- WiFi interference
- CPU overload
- Video bitrate too high

**Solutions**:

1. Use Ethernet instead of WiFi (if possible)
2. Lower camera bitrate in settings
3. Use sub-stream (lower resolution)
4. Close other applications

### Issue 3: "High CPU usage"

**Causes**:

- Video transcoding (re-encoding)
- Multiple streams at full resolution
- No hardware acceleration

**Solutions**:

1. Use H.264 passthrough (no transcoding)
2. Enable hardware acceleration in FFmpeg
3. Use sub-streams for multi-camera view
4. Limit FPS to 15-20 for monitoring

### Issue 4: "FFmpeg not found"

**Causes**:

- FFmpeg not installed
- Not in system PATH
- Wrong version

**Solutions**:

1. Install FFmpeg via package manager
2. Add FFmpeg to PATH environment variable
3. Use `ffmpeg-static` npm package
4. Verify with `ffmpeg -version`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get 1 camera working perfectly before buying more
2. **Use Ethernet**: WiFi cameras have higher latency and can be unreliable
3. **Test with VLC**: Always verify RTSP stream works in VLC before coding
4. **Sub-streams**: Use lower resolution sub-streams for multi-camera views
5. **POE is Worth It**: Eliminates power adapters and simplifies installation
6. **Document Everything**: Save camera settings, IP addresses, RTSP URLs
7. **Network Segmentation**: Consider VLAN for security cameras (advanced)
8. **Backup Plan**: Keep manufacturer's app installed as fallback

# Issue Resolution Summary - October 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ‚úÖ Arlo CORS Error (14:30 - 14:34)

**Problem**: Camera API blocked by CORS
**Cause**: Arlo proxy worker not deployed
**Fix**: Deployed proxy to `homehub-arlo-proxy.andernet.workers.dev`
**Doc**: `docs/development/ARLO_CORS_FIX_OCT15_2025.md`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Devices Not Showing (16:47 - 16:51)

**Problem**: Devices page completely empty
**Cause**: Dashboard using `[]` as default, cleared localStorage
**Fix**: Changed Dashboard to use `MOCK_DEVICES` as default
**Doc**: `docs/development/DEVICES_NOT_SHOWING_FIX_OCT15_2025.md`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Only Cameras Showing (17:44 - 19:03)

**Problem**: Only cameras visible, no lights/sensors
**Cause**: localStorage still had empty array from previous bug
**Fix**: Added migration script to auto-restore devices on startup
**Doc**: `docs/development/DEVICE_MIGRATION_FIX_OCT15_2025.md`

---

## Final Status

### ‚úÖ Production Site Working

**URL**: https://homehub.andernet.dev

**What's Working**:

- ‚úÖ Arlo cameras loading via proxy
- ‚úÖ All 27 mock devices showing (lights, thermostats, sensors)
- ‚úÖ Devices organized by rooms
- ‚úÖ Camera snapshots and live streaming
- ‚úÖ Device controls (on/off, brightness, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Automatic device migration on startup

### Deployed Workers

1. **KV Worker**: `homehub-kv-worker.andernet.workers.dev`
2. **Arlo Proxy**: `homehub-arlo-proxy.andernet.workers.dev` ‚≠ê NEW

### Debug Tools Created

1. `debug-tools/check-device-data.html` - Simple device checker
2. `debug-tools/device-storage-inspector.html` - Full storage inspector ‚≠ê NEW

---

## Technical Improvements

### Code Changes

1. ‚úÖ Fixed `ArloAdapter.ts` - Correct production URL
2. ‚úÖ Fixed `Dashboard.tsx` - Use MOCK_DEVICES default
3. ‚úÖ Created `migrate-devices.ts` - Auto-repair empty storage
4. ‚úÖ Updated `main.tsx` - Run migration on startup

### Architecture Enhancements

- **Automatic migration**: Repairs empty/corrupted device storage
- **Startup checks**: Validates data before React renders
- **Fallback patterns**: Always has devices, never empty
- **Debug tooling**: Easy inspection of localStorage state

---

## User Verification

**User confirmed**: "they are!" ‚úÖ

All devices now visible:

- üí° Lights (Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen, Office, etc.)
- üå°Ô∏è Thermostats (Main Floor, Upstairs)
- üîí Security sensors (Front Door, Back Door, Windows)
- üìπ Arlo cameras (Front Door, Backyard, Driveway, etc.)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Default Values Matter

Empty arrays `[]` can be destructive when used as defaults in `useKV()`.

**Bad**:

```typescript
useKV<Device[]>(KV_KEYS.DEVICES, []) // Overwrites data!
```

**Good**:

```typescript
useKV<Device[]>(KV_KEYS.DEVICES, MOCK_DEVICES) // Safe fallback
```

### 2. localStorage Persists

Even after fixing code, user's browser still had old data. Need migration scripts to repair existing installations.

### 3. Separate Storage

Cameras (`kv:security-cameras`) and devices (`kv:devices`) are stored separately. This created confusion when only one was empty.

### 4. Migration Scripts

Running validation/migration on app startup is essential for production apps with persistent storage.

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Check all `useKV()` default values
- [ ] Verify defaults match mock data
- [ ] Test empty localStorage scenario
- [ ] Test corrupted localStorage scenario

### 2. Testing Protocol

- [ ] Clear localStorage before testing
- [ ] Test different tab navigation orders
- [ ] Test with/without network
- [ ] Test page refresh behavior

### 3. Monitoring

- [ ] Add logging for migration events
- [ ] Track empty storage occurrences
- [ ] Monitor device count in production
- [ ] Alert on zero devices

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate

- ‚úÖ All critical issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Production site stable
- ‚úÖ User confirmed working

### Future Enhancements

1. **Version tracking**: Track migration version in localStorage
2. **Backup system**: Backup before migration
3. **User notifications**: Toast when migration runs
4. **Health dashboard**: Show storage health in Settings
5. **Export/Import**: Let users backup/restore their data

# E2E Testing Status - Phase 2

**Date**: January 17, 2025
**Status**: IN PROGRESS üî∂
**Progress**: CI/CD ‚úÖ | E2E Tests üî∂ | A11y Expansion ‚è≥

## Summary

Successfully implemented CI/CD workflow and began E2E test execution. E2E tests currently failing due to application startup issues - requires debugging the dev server or Playwright configuration.

## Completed Work

### 1. ‚úÖ CI/CD Integration (100% Complete)

**Files Created**:

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Comprehensive 4-job workflow

**Features**:

- **Job 1: Unit & Integration Tests** - Runs npm test:run with coverage uploads
- **Job 2: Accessibility Tests** - Runs axe-core tests with result artifacts
- **Job 3: E2E Tests (Playwright)** - Installs browsers, runs E2E tests, captures screenshots/videos
- **Job 4: Lint & Type Check** - ESLint + TypeScript validation
- **Job 5: Test Summary** - Aggregates all results and fails if any job fails

**CI Configuration Highlights**:

```yaml
- Node.js 20
- npm ci for reproducible installs
- Parallel job execution (faster CI runs)
- Artifact uploads (test reports, screenshots, videos, coverage)
- GitHub Actions reporter on CI
- Browser auto-install (chromium + webkit)
- 30-day artifact retention
```

**Badge Added to README**:

```markdown

```

**Estimated CI Run Time**: 5-8 minutes per commit

### 2. üî∂ E2E Test Execution (30% Complete)

**Status**: Tests created, Dashboard testid added, Chromium-only config, but tests failing

**Issue Discovered**:
All 11 E2E tests timing out waiting for `[data-testid="dashboard"]` element. This suggests:

1. Dev server not starting correctly for Playwright
2. Application not loading in test browser
3. Dashboard component not rendering during tests

**What Worked**:

- ‚úÖ Added `data-testid="dashboard"` to Dashboard component (line 633)
- ‚úÖ Disabled Mobile Safari tests (webkit browser not installed)
- ‚úÖ Modified playwright.config.ts to chromium-only
- ‚úÖ Playwright browsers installed (chromium)
- ‚úÖ Dev server configuration looks correct (webServer.command: 'npm run dev')

**What Didn't Work**:

- ‚ùå All tests timeout after 10-30 seconds
- ‚ùå Dashboard element never appears in browser
- ‚ùå No console errors visible in test output

**Screenshots/Videos Captured**:

- All test failures have attached screenshots in `test-results/`
- Videos show blank page or loading state
- Error context files available for debugging

**Next Debugging Steps**:

1. Check if dev server is actually starting (port 5173)
2. Test manually opening http://localhost:5173 during Playwright run
3. Add console.log debugging to see what Playwright sees
4. Check for React hydration errors or initialization problems
5. Consider using `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` instead of waitForSelector
6. Review Playwright HTML report: http://localhost:9323

**Modified Files**:

- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Added `data-testid="dashboard"`
- `playwright.config.ts` - Commented out Mobile Safari project

---

### 3. ‚è≥ Accessibility Expansion (0% Complete - Pending)

**Planned Work**:

- Add `data-testid` attributes to Dashboard sub-components
- Add `data-testid` attributes to Rooms component
- Add `data-testid` attributes to Scenes component
- Create component-specific a11y tests
- Test with real component rendering (not just HTML patterns)

**Deferred Until**: E2E tests are working (need test infrastructure stable first)

## Technical Details

### CI/CD Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push to main/develop, pull_request to main]

jobs:
  unit-integration: # npm test:run + coverage
  accessibility: # npm test:a11y
  e2e: # Playwright with browser install
  lint: # type-check + eslint
  test-summary: # Aggregates all results
```

### Playwright Configuration

**Browsers**: Chromium only (Mobile Safari disabled)
**Timeout**: 30s per test
**Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
**Workers**: 1 on CI (sequential), undefined locally (parallel)
**Trace**: On first retry
**Screenshot**: On failure only
**Video**: Retain on failure

**Dev Server**:

- Command: `npm run dev`
- URL: http://localhost:5173
- Reuse existing: Yes (unless CI)
- Timeout: 120s

### Dashboard Component Changes

**File**: `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
**Line**: 633
**Change**: Added `data-testid="dashboard"` to root div

```tsx
// Before
return (
  <div className={cn('bg-background flex h-full flex-col', highContrastMode && 'high-contrast')}>

// After
return (
  <div data-testid="dashboard" className={cn('bg-background flex h-full flex-col', highContrastMode && 'high-contrast')}>
```

## Debugging E2E Failures

### Hypothesis 1: Dev Server Not Starting

**Test**:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (wait for server to start)
npm run test:e2e
```

**Expected**: Tests should pass if dev server is pre-started

---

### Hypothesis 2: React Hydration Error

**Test**: Check browser console in Playwright HTML report

1. Open http://localhost:9323
2. Click on failed test
3. View screenshot/video
4. Look for React errors in console

**Expected**: May see "Hydration failed" or similar error

---

### Hypothesis 3: Wrong Selector

**Test**: Use Playwright Inspector

```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

Then in test, pause and inspect what elements exist:

```typescript
await page.pause() // Playwright will open inspector
await page.locator('[data-testid="dashboard"]').highlight()
```

---

### Hypothesis 4: Timing Issue

**Test**: Replace waitForSelector with waitForLoadState

```typescript
// Current (failing)
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="dashboard"]', { timeout: 10000 })

// Alternative
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="dashboard"]', { timeout: 30000 })

// Or wait for text content
await page.waitForFunction(() => document.querySelector('[data-testid="dashboard"]') !== null)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Add testids Early**: Should have added data-testid attributes during component development, not during testing
2. **Start Dev Server Separately**: Playwright's webServer config may have startup issues - test with pre-started server first
3. **Screenshot Debugging**: Playwright's screenshot/video capture is invaluable for debugging headless browser issues
4. **Mobile Browser Installation**: webkit/firefox browsers require separate installation, chromium is default
5. **Incremental Testing**: Get 1 test passing before trying to fix all 11 - validate approach first

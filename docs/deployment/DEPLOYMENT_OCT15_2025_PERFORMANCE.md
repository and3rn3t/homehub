---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Format code (optional but recommended)
npm run format

# 2. Stage changes
git add src/components/SecurityCameras.tsx
git add src/App.tsx
git add src/components/UniversalVideoPlayer.tsx
git add docs/development/LANDING_PAGE_*.md
git add docs/development/VIDEO_PLAYER_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "perf: lazy load video player modal - 96% Security bundle reduction

- Lazy load CameraDetailsModal in SecurityCameras component
- Reduces Security bundle from 487 KB → 21 KB gzipped (-96%)
- Total initial load: 900 KB → 435 KB (-52%)
- Modal loads on-demand when user clicks camera
- Expected performance: 27/100 → 55-65/100 first visit

Technical changes:
- Add lazy() import for CameraDetailsModal
- Wrap modal in Suspense with loading spinner
- Vite automatically creates 467 KB separate chunk
- No breaking changes to functionality

Testing:
- Build verified: Security bundle 21.38 KB gzipped ✅
- Video playback should work identically
- Loading spinner shows during first modal load

Docs:
- Complete analysis in LANDING_PAGE_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE_OCT15_2025.md
- Technical plan in LANDING_PAGE_OPTIMIZATION_OCT15_2025.md
- Quick reference in LANDING_PAGE_OPTIMIZATION_QUICKREF.md"

# 4. Push to main (if tests pass)
git push origin main

# 5. Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy
```

### Option 2: Test First (Safer)

```bash
# 1. Test locally first
npm run dev
# - Open http://localhost:5173
# - Test Security tab and video playback
# - Verify no console errors

# 2. If tests pass, follow Option 1 steps above
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (< 5 minutes)

Visit production URL after deploy:

1. **Homepage loads** ✅
   - Should be noticeably faster
   - No console errors

2. **Security tab loads** ✅
   - Should load in <1 second
   - Camera grid displays
   - Pull-to-refresh works

3. **Camera modal works** ✅
   - Click any camera card
   - May show loading spinner first time (good!)
   - Modal opens with camera details
   - Video player visible

4. **Video playback works** ✅
   - Click play button on video
   - Stream should start (HLS or DASH)
   - Controls work (play/pause, mute, fullscreen)

### Performance Checks (< 10 minutes)

1. **Run Lighthouse** (production URL)

   ```bash
   npm run lighthouse:baseline
   ```

   - First Visit Performance: Target 55-65/100 (was 27/100)
   - Repeat Visit Performance: Target 85-95/100 (was 80-90/100)

2. **Check Network Tab** (Chrome DevTools)
   - Initial load: ~435 KB JavaScript (was ~900 KB)
   - Security tab: ~21 KB chunk loads
   - Camera click: ~467 KB CameraDetailsModal chunk loads

3. **Check Service Worker** (Application tab)
   - Should precache new chunks
   - Repeat visits should be instant

### Rollback Triggers 🚨

**Roll back immediately if**:

- ❌ Security tab doesn't load
- ❌ Modal doesn't open when clicking camera
- ❌ Video playback doesn't work
- ❌ Console shows React errors
- ❌ App crashes or white screen

**Rollback command**:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Must-Have (Deploy Blockers)

- ✅ Security tab loads without errors
- ✅ Camera modal opens on click
- ✅ Video playback works
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Build succeeds

### Nice-to-Have (Post-Deploy Validation)

- 🎯 Security tab loads in <1s (was 3-5s)
- 🎯 Lighthouse Performance 55+/100 first visit (was 27/100)
- 🎯 Initial load <500 KB (was ~900 KB)
- 🎯 No user-reported issues within 24h

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### If Issues Found

1. **Immediate Rollback** (< 2 minutes)

   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   # Wait for Cloudflare Pages to redeploy (~2 min)
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback**
   - Security tab loads
   - Video playback works
   - Bundle size back to 487 KB (expected)

3. **Investigate Issue**
   - Check production logs
   - Review browser console errors
   - Test on different browsers/devices

4. **Fix and Redeploy**
   - Address root cause
   - Test thoroughly
   - Redeploy when ready

### Partial Rollback (Nuclear Option)

If only modal is broken but Security tab works:

```bash
# Revert just SecurityCameras.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/SecurityCameras.tsx
git commit -m "revert: restore static CameraDetailsModal import"
git push origin main
```

This keeps other changes but removes lazy loading.

## 📞 Support & Monitoring

### What to Monitor

1. **Cloudflare Analytics**
   - Page load times (should decrease)
   - Error rates (should stay same)
   - Bounce rate (should stay same)

2. **Browser Console** (user reports)
   - "Chunk load error" - network issue or cache problem
   - "React hook error" - unlikely but would be critical

3. **Service Worker**
   - Cache hit rate (should increase)
   - New chunk caching (467 KB modal)

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Loading chunk failed"

**Cause**: Network interruption during chunk download
**Solution**: User needs to refresh page
**Prevention**: Service worker will cache chunk after first load

#### Issue: Modal shows infinite spinner

**Cause**: Chunk failed to load
**Solution**: Check network, refresh page
**Prevention**: Add error boundary with retry

#### Issue: Video doesn't play

**Cause**: Not related to this change (modal loads, player doesn't initialize)
**Solution**: Check DASH/HLS libraries, Arlo API
**Prevention**: This change doesn't affect video player logic

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

**Before Deploy**:

- Security tab: 3-5 seconds to load (487 KB bundle)
- First-time visit: 27/100 Performance Score
- Initial load: ~900 KB JavaScript

**After Deploy**:

- Security tab: <1 second to load (21 KB bundle) ✅
- First-time visit: 55-65/100 Performance Score ✅
- Initial load: ~435 KB JavaScript ✅
- Camera modal: 2-3s first click (467 KB download), instant after (cached) ✅

**User Experience**:

- **Dramatically faster** Security tab
- **Minimal downside**: Brief loading spinner on first camera click
- **Net benefit**: Massive - most users never open camera modal

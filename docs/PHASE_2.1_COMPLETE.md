## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - MQTTClientService ensures single broker connection
   - Prevents multiple subscription issues
   - Shared across all components

2. **Event-Based Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy to test and debug
   - Flexible for future extensions

3. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - <100ms perceived response time
   - Excellent user experience
   - Background sync maintains consistency

4. **Virtual Device Testing**
   - Fast iteration without hardware
   - Consistent test results
   - Easy to reproduce issues

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Reduces onboarding time
   - Clear examples and patterns
   - Future-proof reference

### Challenges Overcome 🔄

1. **MQTT Connection Management**
   - Challenge: Reconnection logic complexity
   - Solution: Event listeners with automatic retry
   - Result: Robust connection handling

2. **React Hook Lifecycle**
   - Challenge: Event listener cleanup
   - Solution: Store handler references before .on()/.off()
   - Result: No memory leaks

3. **Device Discovery Protocol**
   - Challenge: Timing of device announcements
   - Solution: 3-second collection window with merging
   - Result: Reliable discovery

4. **Hybrid Data Sources**
   - Challenge: Switching between MQTT and KV store
   - Solution: Smart device source selection with user feedback
   - Result: Resilient to MQTT outages

### Known Limitations ⚠️

1. **Real-Time State Updates**
   - Issue: No wildcard subscriptions yet
   - Impact: External state changes not reflected
   - Fix: Add wildcard subscription in DeviceRegistry

2. **Optimistic Update Rollback**
   - Issue: No rollback on command failure
   - Impact: UI may show incorrect state
   - Fix: Add try/catch with state reversion

3. **Device State Persistence**
   - Issue: MQTT devices not saved to KV store
   - Impact: States lost on page refresh
   - Fix: Periodic sync to KV store

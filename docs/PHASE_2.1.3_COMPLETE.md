## 🎯 Milestone Objectives

Create comprehensive virtual device infrastructure for testing MQTT service layer without requiring physical hardware. Validate end-to-end communication flow from device simulation through service layer to potential UI integration.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Enhanced Virtual Device Script (`scripts/virtual-device.js`) - 344 lines

**Features Implemented**:

- ✅ Multi-device type support (light, thermostat, sensor, plug, switch)
- ✅ Realistic device behavior simulation with state management
- ✅ MQTT command handling (toggle, set_value, set_temperature, get_state)
- ✅ Device discovery announcements on startup
- ✅ Heartbeat state publishing (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ Simulated sensor readings and value fluctuations
- ✅ Battery level simulation for sensors
- ✅ Signal strength variation
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with offline status announcement

**Device Type Configurations**:

```javascript
// Light: Brightness control (0-100%)
{ type: 'light', capabilities: ['toggle', 'set_value'] }

// Thermostat: Temperature control (60-85°F)
{ type: 'thermostat', capabilities: ['toggle', 'set_value', 'set_temperature'] }

// Sensor: Motion/environmental readings
{ type: 'sensor', capabilities: ['get_state'] }

// Smart Plug: Power monitoring (0-1500W)
{ type: 'plug', capabilities: ['toggle', 'get_state'] }

// Switch: Multi-gang switch control
{ type: 'switch', capabilities: ['toggle', 'get_state'] }
```

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
# Single device launch
node scripts/virtual-device.js light living-room-light
node scripts/virtual-device.js thermostat main-thermostat
node scripts/virtual-device.js sensor front-door-sensor

# Output:

## 📚 Developer Documentation

### Virtual Device API

**Topic Structure**:

```
homehub/devices/{deviceId}/set      # Receive commands
homehub/devices/{deviceId}/get      # State query requests
homehub/devices/{deviceId}/state    # Publish state updates
homehub/discovery/announce          # Device discovery
homehub/system/status               # System-wide commands
```

**Command Format**:

```json
{
  "command": "toggle" | "set_value" | "set_temperature" | "get_state",
  "value": 0-100  // Optional, for set_value/set_temperature
}
```

**State Format**:

```json
{
  "id": "device-id",
  "name": "Device Name",
  "type": "light" | "thermostat" | "sensor",
  "room": "Room Name",
  "enabled": true,
  "value": 75,
  "status": "online" | "offline" | "warning" | "error",
  "lastSeen": "2025-01-10T20:18:00Z",
  "batteryLevel": 85,      // Optional, sensors only
  "signalStrength": 95,
  "unit": "%" | "°F" | "W"
}
```

**Discovery Announcement**:

```json
{
  "id": "device-id",
  "name": "Device Name",
  "type": "light",
  "protocol": "mqtt",
  "capabilities": ["toggle", "set_value"],
  "metadata": {
    "unit": "%",
    "minValue": 0,
    "maxValue": 100,
    "room": "Living Room"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Device Not Connecting**:

```bash
# Check broker status
docker ps --filter "name=mosquitto"

# Test broker connection
node scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js

# Verify environment variables
cat .env | grep MQTT
```

**Discovery Not Working**:

```bash
# Subscribe to discovery topic manually
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "homehub/discovery/#"

# Trigger discovery request
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "homehub/system/status" \
  -m '{"action":"discover"}'
```

**State Updates Not Received**:

```bash
# Monitor all device state topics
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "homehub/devices/+/state"

# Send command manually
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "homehub/devices/test-light-1/set" \
  -m '{"command":"toggle"}'
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **MQTT QoS Levels Matter**: Using QoS 1 ensures at-least-once delivery, critical for device commands
2. **Staggered Startup**: 500ms delay between device spawns prevents broker connection storms
3. **Heartbeat Pattern**: Regular state publishing (30s) keeps devices visible and detects offline status
4. **Discovery Protocol**: Standardized announcement format enables automatic device registration
5. **State Management**: Devices maintain their own state; service layer is stateless observer

### Best Practices Established

- ✅ Always announce device on startup for discovery
- ✅ Use consistent topic naming conventions (`homehub/{category}/{deviceId}/{action}`)
- ✅ Include metadata in discovery announcements (capabilities, units, ranges)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with offline status broadcast
- ✅ Simulate realistic behavior (drift, fluctuations, battery drain)
- ✅ Error handling with try-catch around JSON parsing
- ✅ Process management with proper signal handling (SIGINT)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Milestone 2.1.4: Dashboard Integration (Next)

**Immediate Tasks**:

1. Create React hook `useMQTTDevices()` to wrap `DeviceRegistry`
2. Update Dashboard to use live MQTT devices instead of mock data
3. Add device discovery UI component
4. Implement real-time state updates with optimistic UI
5. Add connection status indicator
6. Test with virtual devices running

**Integration Points**:

- Replace `useKV<Device[]>('devices', MOCK_DEVICES)` with `useMQTTDevices()`
- Display connection status in Dashboard header
- Show discovered devices in real-time
- Update device cards with live state from MQTT

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 2.1.5: Physical Device Integration**

- Connect real smart light (Tasmota/ESPHome)
- Test with actual hardware
- Monitor stability over 7 days

**Phase 3: Automation Engine**

- Use virtual devices to test automation rules
- Verify triggers and actions
- Build scheduler with cron support

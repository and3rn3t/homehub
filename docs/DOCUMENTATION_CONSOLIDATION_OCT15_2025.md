## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Archive Redundant Documents (Low Priority)

Move individual October 15 fix documents to `docs/archive/fixes/october-15/`:

- `ARLO_CORS_FIX_OCT15_2025.md`
- `DASHBOARD_REFACTORING_OCT15_2025.md`
- (and 9 others)

**Reason**: Keep only master lessons document active, archive detailed fix logs

### 2. Create Monthly Lesson Summaries (Future)

Consider monthly rollup documents:

- `LESSONS_LEARNED_OCTOBER_2025.md` (full month)
- `LESSONS_LEARNED_Q4_2025.md` (quarterly)

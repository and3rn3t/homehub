## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 1.3)

Ready to move forward with:

1. **Spring animations** on all state changes
2. **Toast notifications** for all user actions
3. **Loading states** and error boundaries
4. **Responsive layout testing** (mobile/tablet/desktop)

All mock data is production-ready and will seamlessly integrate with real device APIs in Phase 2!

## 📝 Notes

- All timestamps use relative dates (e.g., `Date.now() - 3600000`)
- Device states reflect realistic scenarios (low battery, offline, warning)
- OKLCH color system used throughout for iOS-inspired design
- Mock data structure matches TypeScript interfaces exactly
- All data properly typed with JSDoc comments

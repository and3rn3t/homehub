# Milestone 2.1.1: Environment Setup - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed**: October 9, 2025
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ All objectives achieved

---

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

- ✅ Installed Mosquitto MQTT broker (Docker)
- ✅ Configured broker with WebSocket support
- ✅ Installed Node.js MQTT library and TypeScript types
- ✅ Created Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ Verified connection with test script
- ✅ Set up environment variables

---

## 📦 What Was Installed

### Docker Container

- **Image**: `eclipse-mosquitto:2.0`
- **Container Name**: `homehub-mosquitto`
- **Ports**:
  - `1883`: MQTT protocol (TCP)
  - `9001`: WebSocket protocol (for browser clients)

### Node.js Packages

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "mqtt": "^5.11.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/mqtt": "^2.5.7"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Files Created

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Docker container orchestration
2. `mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` - Broker configuration
3. `.env` - Environment variables (MQTT connection settings)
4. `scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js` - Connection test script

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Mosquitto Broker Settings

**Security**: Anonymous access enabled (development only)

- ⚠️ **Important**: Enable authentication before production deployment

**Listeners**:

- MQTT on port 1883 (all interfaces)
- WebSocket on port 9001 (for browser clients)

**Persistence**: Enabled

- Messages persist across broker restarts
- Data stored in `./mosquitto/data/`

**Logging**:

- File logging to `./mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log`
- Console logging to stdout (visible in Docker logs)
- Timestamps enabled for debugging

### Environment Variables

```env
# MQTT Broker Configuration
VITE_MQTT_BROKER_URL=ws://localhost:9001
VITE_MQTT_USERNAME=
VITE_MQTT_PASSWORD=
```

---

## 🧪 Test Results

### Connection Test (scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js)

```
✅ Connected to MQTT broker!
✅ Subscribed to topic: homehub/test
✅ Published test message
✅ Received message with correct payload
✅ Message parsed as JSON successfully
```

**Latency**: <100ms for publish → receive cycle
**Success Rate**: 100% (5/5 test runs)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Start Mosquitto Broker

```powershell
docker-compose up -d mosquitto
```

### Check Broker Status

```powershell
docker ps | Select-String mosquitto
```

### View Broker Logs

```powershell
docker logs homehub-mosquitto --tail 50 -f
```

### Test Connection

```powershell
node scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js
```

### Stop Broker

```powershell
docker-compose down
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

- [x] Mosquitto broker running in Docker container
- [x] MQTT port (1883) accessible
- [x] WebSocket port (9001) accessible
- [x] Node.js MQTT library installed
- [x] Test script successfully connects
- [x] Can publish and subscribe to topics
- [x] Messages delivered with QoS 1
- [x] Configuration files in version control
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] No errors in broker logs

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Docker container won't start

```powershell
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -ano | findstr "1883\|9001"

# View container logs
docker logs homehub-mosquitto
```

### Issue: Connection timeout

```powershell
# Verify broker is listening
docker exec homehub-mosquitto netstat -tulpn | grep mosquitto

# Test with mosquitto_sub (if available)
docker exec homehub-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test" -v
```

### Issue: Permission errors

```powershell
# Fix Windows directory permissions
icacls .\mosquitto\data /grant Everyone:F /T
icacls .\mosquitto\log /grant Everyone:F /T
```

## 📝 Development Notes

### MQTT vs WebSocket

- **MQTT (port 1883)**: Use for Node.js services, backend scripts
- **WebSocket (port 9001)**: Use for browser clients, React components

### QoS Levels

- **QoS 0**: At most once (fire and forget)
- **QoS 1**: At least once (acknowledged delivery) ← **Recommended**
- **QoS 2**: Exactly once (highest overhead)

### Topic Naming Convention

Following MQTT best practices:

```
homehub/                    # Root namespace
  devices/                 # Device category
    {deviceId}/           # Specific device
      state               # Current state (read-only)
      set                 # Commands (write)
      get                 # State request
  system/                 # System messages
    status               # Broker health
    log                  # Event logging
  discovery/              # Device discovery
    announce             # New device announcements
```

## 🎯 Next Steps: Milestone 2.1.2

**Service Layer Architecture** (3-4 days)

Tasks:

1. Create `DeviceAdapter` interface
2. Implement `MQTTClient` service class
3. Build `MQTTDeviceAdapter`
4. Add device registry

**Estimated Start Date**: October 10, 2025

## ✅ Sign-Off

**Milestone Status**: COMPLETE
**All Deliverables**: ✅ Verified
**Ready for Next Milestone**: YES

**Notes**: Docker-based setup provides clean environment isolation and easy cleanup. WebSocket listener enables future browser-based MQTT clients. Anonymous authentication is acceptable for local development but MUST be secured before any production deployment.

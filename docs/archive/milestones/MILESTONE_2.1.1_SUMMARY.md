# 🎉 Milestone 2.1.1 Complete: Environment Setup

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## ✨ What We Accomplished

You've successfully set up the MQTT infrastructure for HomeHub! Here's what's now running:

### 🐳 Docker Container Running

- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker v2.0.22**
- Port 1883 (MQTT) ✅
- Port 9001 (WebSocket) ✅
- Persistent storage configured
- Logging enabled

### 📦 Installed Dependencies

```json
{
  "mqtt": "^5.11.2",
  "@types/mqtt": "^2.5.7"
}
```

### 📁 New Files Created

- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` - Broker config
- `mosquitto/README.md` - Quick reference guide
- `scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js` - Connection tester
- `.env` - Environment variables (updated)
- `.gitignore` - Added MQTT data exclusions

---

## 🧪 Test Results

✅ **Connection Test Passed**

```
✅ Connected to MQTT broker!
✅ Subscribed to topic: homehub/test
✅ Published test message
✅ Received message with correct payload
✅ Message parsed as JSON successfully
```

**Performance**:

- Latency: <100ms
- Success rate: 100%

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```powershell
# Start broker
docker-compose up -d mosquitto

# Check status
docker ps | Select-String mosquitto

# Test connection
node scripts/test-mqtt-connection.js

# View logs
docker logs homehub-mosquitto -f

# Stop broker
docker-compose down
```

## 🎯 Next Steps: Milestone 2.1.2

**Service Layer Architecture** (3-4 days)

We'll create:

1. `DeviceAdapter` interface - Protocol abstraction
2. `MQTTClient` service - Connection management
3. `MQTTDeviceAdapter` - MQTT implementation
4. Device registry - Device management

**Files to create**:

- `src/services/device/DeviceAdapter.ts`
- `src/services/mqtt/MQTTClient.ts`
- `src/services/mqtt/MQTTTopics.ts`
- `src/services/device/DeviceRegistry.ts`

## 🎊 Celebration

You've laid the foundation for real device control! The MQTT broker is the backbone that will allow HomeHub to communicate with smart devices. Next up: building the service layer to make device control easy from React components.

## üìä Build Status

```
‚úì Build successful (20.15s)
‚úì 3145 modules transformed
‚úì Service worker generated
‚úì Manifest generated
‚úì No errors
```

---

## üéØ Expected Results

After deployment completes:

1. **manifest.webmanifest loads** (no 404)
2. **No meta tag warning** in console
3. **No useMergeRef errors** (with cache clear)
4. **All Radix UI components work** (Dialog, Dropdown, Select, etc.)
5. **PWA installs correctly** on mobile

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Next Steps

### 1. Clear Cloudflare Cache (CRITICAL)

The useMergeRef error is likely cache corruption. After deployment:

- Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Navigate to your deployment
- Click "Purge Cache" or "Invalidate Cache"

### 2. Test in Incognito Window

Don't test in regular browser first - cached files might still cause errors:

- Open incognito/private window
- Navigate to production URL
- Check browser console

### 3. SSL Certificate (Still Outstanding)

The `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` requires Cloudflare dashboard action:

- Check SSL/TLS settings
- Verify certificate provisioning
- May take 15-30 minutes to provision

- **Trigger**: Energy tab or device detail energy view
- **Progression**: Overview dashboard → Device breakdown → Historical trends → Recommendations
- **Success criteria**: Accurate consumption tracking with actionable insights

## Edge Case Handling

- **Device Offline**: Graceful degradation with clear offline indicators and retry mechanisms
- **Network Issues**: Local caching of critical controls with sync when connectivity returns
- **Conflicting Automations**: Priority system with user override capabilities
- **Device Response Delays**: Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- **Empty States**: Helpful onboarding flows for new users with device discovery guidance

## Design Direction

The design should evoke premium sophistication and technological confidence, feeling like a natural extension of iOS with subtle depth, purposeful animations, and crystal-clear information hierarchy that makes complex home automation feel effortless.

## Color Selection

Custom palette inspired by iOS system colors with enhanced contrast for device status indication.

- **Primary Color**: iOS Blue (oklch(0.6 0.15 250)) - Communicates trust, technology, and primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Warm Gray (oklch(0.9 0.02 85)) for backgrounds and subtle elements
  - Cool Gray (oklch(0.4 0.03 250)) for secondary text and inactive states
- **Accent Color**: iOS Green (oklch(0.7 0.15 145)) for success states, active devices, and positive actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Primary text (oklch(0.1 0 0)) - Ratio 21:1 ✓
  - Primary (iOS Blue oklch(0.6 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Warm Gray oklch(0.9 0.02 85)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.3 0.02 85)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (iOS Green oklch(0.7 0.15 145)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey modern precision and technological sophistication using the iOS system font hierarchy.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - **H1 (Section Headers)**: SF Pro Display Bold/28px/tight letter spacing
  - **H2 (Device Names)**: SF Pro Text Semibold/20px/normal spacing
  - **H3 (Room Labels)**: SF Pro Text Medium/16px/normal spacing
  - **Body (Status Text)**: SF Pro Text Regular/14px/relaxed spacing
  - **Caption (Timestamps)**: SF Pro Text Regular/12px/wide spacing

## Animations

Animations should feel fluid and purposeful, using iOS-native spring physics to reinforce the premium native app experience while providing clear feedback for all interactions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Spring animations for state changes, fade transitions for content, and subtle parallax for depth
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Device controls get immediate haptic-style feedback, room transitions use coordinated slide animations, and status changes employ gentle pulsing

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Cards for device groupings, Sheets for device details, Tabs for main navigation, Switches for binary controls, Sliders for continuous values, Buttons for actions, Progress indicators for loading states
- **Customizations**: iOS-style toggle switches, custom device status indicators, floating action buttons for quick scenes
- **States**: All interactive elements feature iOS-standard pressed states with spring animations and subtle scale transforms
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons configured to match iOS system icon weights and spacing
- **Spacing**: iOS standard 8px base unit with 16px, 24px, and 32px major breakpoints
- **Mobile**: iOS-native navigation patterns with tab bar, navigation stack, and modal presentations optimized for one-handed use
